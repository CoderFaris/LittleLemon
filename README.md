# LittleLemon
This is a Back-end capstone project that required me to:
- Connect the Little Lemon restaurant back-end to MySQL
- Set up the Little Lemon restaurant booking api
- Insert booking data in the database via the booking API

# How to run it
(install python first and the required libs if you don't have it on your pc)
```
#create a virtual env using pipenv
pipenv shell

pipenv install django
pipenv install djangorestframework
pipenv install djoser
pipenv install mysqlclient
```

```
create database littlelemon;
use littlelemon;
CREATE USER 'django'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON littlelemon.* TO 'django'@'localhost';
```
